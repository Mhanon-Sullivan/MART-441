''Thank you so much, you guys! Here,'' she shoves her hand into a little purse at her side and pulls out two pearls: one for you and one for the crab. ''For you both. I'm Darcie, by the way. Thank you again! I hope we meet again soon! Hopefully without the fishing line, next time,'' she chuckles. With that, she scooches back over to the water and slides right in with a soft splash.
